# ðŸ“¦ Releases

A Release is simply an arbitrary file or folder stored on a decentralized storage network that is tagged as a version under a Project.

A Release contains:

* A reference to metadata stored in a decentralized network
* A reference to the file or folder associated with the release

The Valist frontend and SDKs will handle keeping track of the relevant metadata that enables things like multi-platform builds, decentralized web applications, Software Licenses, and more.

You should always be able to download the Release from the network given an `account/project/version`

The metadata for a Release complies with common NFT [metadata structure](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure) so it can easily be rendered on NFT galleries and in wallets.
