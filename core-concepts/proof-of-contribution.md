# ðŸ“¡ Proof of Contribution

Proof of Contribution NFTs allow you to represent the contributions you've made to software, on-chain right in your wallet! Think POAPs, but for Valist Releases that you'd like to commemorate!

Right now minting is done on-demand, with web app integration coming soon!

Join our [Discord](https://valist.io/discord) to learn more!
